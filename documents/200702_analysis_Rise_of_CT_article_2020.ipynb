    "# The Rise of the Cultural Treaty (graphs and analysis related to article draft, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This page is meant as supplementary material to my article, \"The Rise of the Cultural Treaty\" (journal, date). Here I present the tools through which I, in collaboration with [Humlab at the University of Umeå](https://www.umu.se/en/humlab/), conducted the quantitative analysis (and prepared the data visualizations) presented in that article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research on this project was funded by the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens jubileumsfond).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data:\n",
    "Cultural treaties are the bi-lateral and multilateral agreements among states that promote and regulate cooperation and exchange in the fields of life generally called cultural or intellectual. In this article, I approach this source material through two data sets.\n",
    "1. Metadata about all bilateral cultural agreements signed betweeen 1935 and 1972, as collected in the [electronic World Treaty Index (eWTI)](http://worldtreatyindex.com/) (Poast 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The texts of a subset of these agreements. Our sample (or \"corpus\") includes the texts of all general cultural agreements deposited with the treaty services of the League of Nations (LTS) and the United Nations (UNTS) between 1935 and 1972.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metadata\n",
    "A question I address in the article has to do with the definition of a \"cultural treaty.\" Here, I largely follow the coding applied in the eWTI. This, I have confirmed, corresponds closely to categories developed by United Nations officials (see UNESCO 1962). But, as I discuss in the article, I have made several decisions to more sharply define the category. A detailed log of these choices is available as [a wiki on this project's GitHub page](https://github.com/humlab/the_culture_of_international_relations/wiki/eWTI-Notes:-Selection-Decisions-Log-2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "What is relevant here is that I have devised two groupings: the first includes all bilateral agreements that were marked as \"cultural\" by their signatories, by international organizations and later by those responsible for the coding in the eWTI. This broad grouping I mark here at CULT7+. This group includes an important subset: agreements that UNESCO identifies as \"general cultural agreements\" (GCAs). These are bilateral agreements addressing relations in a broad range of fields (education, science, sports, as well as literature and the arts) all in one document. I have coded this subset as 7CULTGEN.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text corpus\n",
    "We have assembled a corpus composed of the complete texts of all genearl cultural treaties (GCAs) deposited with the treaty services of the League of Nations (LTS) and the United Nations (UNTS) between 1935 and 1972 in English translation. These are signed by countries all over the world, although not to an even degree; that is, some countries account for many more such treaties than others. The League and later the UN published the treaties deposited there in book form until the 1990s. The paper volumes have been scanned in and are now accessible through [the UN's treaty collection website](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Home.aspx?clang=_en) in pdf form (with OCR already applied to the English-language text).   \n",
    "\n",
    "### The analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    "This page presents two types of analysis:\n",
    "1. quantitative analysis of metadata on cultural agreements from eWTI\n",
    "2. quantitative text analysis of the treaty text corpus (LTS+UNTS, 1935-1972)\n",
    "\n",
    "I explore each of these in two sections, first addressing the data set as a whole and then dividing it up into several subsets, by state and geographical and/or politco-ideological region. So the overall structure below (as in the article) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. quantitative analysis of metadata on cultural agreements from eWTI\n",
    "2. quantitative text analysis of our treaty text corpus (LTS+UNTS, 1935-1972)\n",
    "3. quantitative analysis of metadata on selected states' cultural agreements from eWTI\n",
    "4. quantitative text analysis of on selected states' agreements in our treaty text corpus (LTS+UNTS, 1935-1972)\n",
    "\n",
    "After some set-up sections, the analysis begins at \"Part 1,\" below."

This shows that cultural treaties never accounted for great portion of total treaty-making; but also that the increases in cultural treaty-making in the late 1950s and mid-1960s cannot simply be attributed to the growth in treaty-making over all. Cultural treaty-making represented on average 2.7% of the total number of treaties signed per year from 1945 to 1955, but 5.7% of all new bilateral agreements signed per year in the following decade (1956 to 1965). In 1966 they represented no less than 7.6%."

The Soviets of course had no lack of experience in pursuing cultural diplomacy. But some set of factors led the regime to turn to this diplomatic tool at this point. A first step to exploring this question is, naturally, to see with which countries the Soviets entered into cultural agreements.\n",

    "This chart displays the number of treaties per time period for each party or group of parties. The time period can be year or one of a predefined set of time period divisions. The default time period division is 1919-1944, 1945-1955, 1956-1966, and 1967-1972, the alternative division has 1940-1944 as an additional period. The third division is a single period between 1945 and 1972 (inclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several parties can be selected using CTRL + click on left mouse button. Shift-Up/Down can also be used to select consecutive parties. Some predefined party sets exist in the \"Preset\" dropdown, and, when selected, the corresponding parties is selected in the \"Parties\" widget. Use the \"Top #n\" slider to display parties with most treaties for each period. Note that a value greater than 0 will disable the \"Parties\" widget since these to selections are mutually exclusive. Set slider back to 0 to enable the \"Parties\" widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The treaty count is based on the following rules:\n",
    "- Treaties outside of selected division are discarded\n",
    "- When \"Is Cultural\" is selected than the only treaties included are those having \"is cultural\" flag in WTI index set to \"Yes\" \n",
    "- When \"Topic is 7CULT\" is selected than all treaties having topic equal to 7CULT are included using original topic value according to WTI i.e. no recoding!\n",
    "- Candidate for removal: When \"No filter\" is selected then no topic filter is applied\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic filter also restricts the extra category count added when \"Other category\" or \"All category\" are selected. When \"Other\" is selected, than the \"complement\" count of the sum of all countries not included is added as a category, and the \"All\" category adds the count of all treaties. Note again, that both these counts are restricted by time period (no treaty outside period), and selected topic filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that when several countries are selected, than the count for a given country is the count of all treaties that country signed for each time period (filtered by topic selection). Each of the treaties that are signed *between* two of the selected parties will hence add +1 for each of the two parties.\n"

    "When the \"Chart per Qty\" toggle is set, then a seperate chart is created for each category (of selected Quantity). Please not that this might take some time if, if the category selection contains many items. Extra charts will also be created for **excluded** category items (i.e. parties not selected or topics not included in topic category) if either of the \"ALL OTHER\" or \"ALL\" party items are selected. In both cases the category filter is applies as for any other chart.\n",

The **category-item**s is the name that will be visible on the chart legend as label for associated list of topic-codes. The **list-of-topic-codes**, finally, must be a list of valid topic codes in the WTI-index (+ 7CORR). Note that these lists within the same category-group should be mutually exclusive i.e. the same code should not be added to more than one group (will give an unpredicted result). Also note that correct braces **must** be used, and strings **must** be surrounded by \"'\", and all topic codes must also be in uppercase. Follow the same syntax as in the existing specifications. "
